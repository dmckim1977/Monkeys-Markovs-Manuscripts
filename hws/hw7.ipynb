We first solve the system of equations for the stationary distribution values {$π_i$}. Then, we calculate the long-term throughput $γ$ which is the dot product of the stationary distribution values and the corresponding service rates. This tells us the effective average arrival rate $λ_{ef}$. Then, using Little's Law, we can find the average waiting time $W_q$. The average number of calls in the entire system $L$ is just the summation of state * probability."
