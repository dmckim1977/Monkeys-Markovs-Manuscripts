    "**Example 7.3:** A corporation must maintain a large fleet of tractors. They have one repairman that works on the tractors as they break down on a first-come first-serve basis. The arrival of tractors to the shop needing repair work is approximated by a Poisson distribution with a mean rate of three per week. The length of time needed for repair varies according to an exponential distribution with a mean repair time of 1/2 week per tractor. The current corporate policy is to utilize an outside repair shop whenever more than two tractors are in the company shop so that, at most, one tractor is allowed to wait. Each week that a tractor spends in the shop costs the company $100. To utilize the outside shop costs $500 per tractor. (The $500 includes lost time.) We wish to review corporate policy and determine the optimum cutoff point for the outside shop; that is, we shall determine the maximum number allowed in the company shop before sending tractors to the outside repair facility."
